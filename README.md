### What

A right click menu item allowing an ontime task to be opened in a new tab if a task id is currently selected.

### Why

Because I'm tired of copying and pasting these things.

### How

1. Download the source or clone the repo
2. Open the extensions section in Chrome
3. Turn on developer mode
4. Click the add unpacked extension button and select the source you downloaded 
5. Select options on the extension and enter your ontime subdomain
6. Right click a selected id and click your new menu item (will also support ids prefixed with ot)
